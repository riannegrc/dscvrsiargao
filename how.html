			<h1>How to get to Siargao Island</h1>
			<p>Getting around the numerous islands of the Philippines isn’t always easy.
			Thankfully, Siargao does have an airport which means flying is a viable 
			and affordable option. Alternatively, you can take the ferry from Surigao 
			city but we’d recommend flying unless Surigao city is already on your route.

			<h3> Flights </h3>
			<p>Direct flights are available from Cebu city, Clark and Manila to 
			Siargao. We recommend booking as far in advance as possible as flights 
			can be quite expensive. To save money we recommend using Momondo as they 
			find the cheapest price for your preferred travel dates.

			<h3> Ferry</h3>
			<p>If you are planning to be in Surigao city, then your best option 
			is to catch the ferry to Dapa port in Siargao. There are daily departures
			with the first being around 6am and the last being around 12pm. 
			The journey time is between 2 and 4 hours depending on the service and 
			tickets cost approximately 200-300 pesos.
			<br>
			From Dapa port you should be able to take a tricycle or habal-habal to your accommodation.
