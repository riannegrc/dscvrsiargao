			<p>Siargao Island is the surfing capital of the Philippines thanks to the waves 
			at Cloud 9. There are plenty more things to do though –adventure to Sugba Lagoon
			and Magpupungko rock pools, or day trip around the islands and enjoy paradise
			beaches. The nature in Siargao makes it one of the best travel destinations in 
			the country, so add it to your Philippines itinerary! This Siargao guide covers
			the best sunset spots, resorts and hotels, cost info, budget tips and more!
			#siargao #philippines   </p>
			<p>Siargao Island is famous for being the best destination for surfing in the 
			Philippines, but there’s much more to the island than that! Although many come
			to the island to ride the great waves of the Cloud 9 reef break, there’s plenty
			for non-surfers to do too. </p>
			<p> <h3>Cloud 9</h3> – the surf break that put Siargao on the map. It’s a perfect tubing right-hand
			reef break that is currently ranked 8th best wave in the world. Cloud 9’s prime months are
			September through November. Cloud 9 is steep, fast, heavy, and breaks over a shallow reef. 
			The wave is still sizable during the winter months, but can get a bit blown out. Cloud 9 is 
			a swell magnet and often still breaks during the summer off-season at a manageable size for 
			advanced-beginner or intermediate surfers. Expect a short paddle out, crowds, some localism,
			and one of the best rides of your life. </p>

			<div class="two"> <img src="images/cloud91.jpg" width="400"> 
			<h3 class="two-text">Other Surf Spots are:</h3>
			<p> <b>Tuason’s Point</b> – a point break that’s a short distance from Cloud 9. 
			Relatively unknown until a few years ago, it can pull a big crowd these days.</p> 
			<p> <b>Stimpy’s</b> – another “experts only” surf spot, and this one is accessible by boat only. 
			The wave take the form of a flawless tubing that hits shallow water.</p>
			<p> <b>Caridad</b> – when in season, Caridad’s got some nice barrels that break on the left. Visit this
			surf spot during the east and north east swells, when the conditions are ideal.</p>
			<p> <b>Pilar</b> – This place is about a 1.5 hour boat ride from General Luna. It’s not always crowded, and is 
			home to two exciting left reef breaks. The place is at its best during the North East swells.</p>
			<p> <b>Jacking Horse </b> – The spot got its name from the wave that jacks at the peak, smashing into the reef. 
			The place is best surfed between mid to high tide.</p>
			<p> <b>Daku Island </b> – Getting to this island means taking a five minute boat ride from General Luna. Here you’ll get to choose from the many breaks. You won’t 
			usually have to compete with other surfers as you would on the beaches as well.</p>

				<div><h3> Magpupungko Rock Pools </h3>
				<p> The Magpupungko rock pools are one of the more unique points of 
				interest in Siargao. </p> 
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="seven"> 
			<h3> Magpupungko Rock Pools</h3>
			<p>A series of naturally formed pools at Magpupungko beach, 
			they are a delightful work of nature. The shallow pools are 
			perfect for swimming, although are equally enjoyable from the 
			water’s edge.
			<br>
			<br>
			The best time to go to the Magpupungko rock pools is low tide as 
			this is the only time they are visible and you are able to swim
			As the tide gets higher the pools become submerged meaning there is 
			only a small amount of time in the day that you can access the pools. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The entrance fee to the Magpupungko rock pools is 50 pesos, and there’s
			also a parking fee of 20 pesos for a scooter/bike and 30 pesos for a 
			tricycle. The rock pools are only really accessible in low tide, which 
			unfortunately makes it hard to avoid crowds during your visit as everyone
			arrives at a similar time.</p>

				<div><h3> Island Hopping   </h3>
				<p>Some of the best beaches in the Philippines can be visited
				on island hopping trips from Siargao. Island hopping is perfect
				if you want to spend your day relaxing on beautiful beaches. All 
				of the tours visit the same spots – Guyam Island, Naked Island and 
				Daku Island.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Guyam is a small paradise-like island covered in palm trees and surrounded 
				by beautifully clear water. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Naked Island is a small sand bank providing a 
				mini beach only reachable by boat. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Daku Island is much bigger and provides 
				a larger beach area to enjoy.
				<br>
				<br></p> 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="seven"> <img src="images/port.jpg" width="250">
			<p>
			If you’d prefer to beat the crowds and have the islands to yourself, 
			we recommend paying for a private boat. This costs just 1,500 pesos and
			you can set off as early as you want. We started our trip from Siargao 
			at around 6.30am and had both Guyam Island and Naked Island completely
			to ourselves. Unless you are travelling solo, it ends up being a similar 
			price to rent a private boat so we fully recommend it!
			To find a boatman in Siargao for a private trip either ask in your 
			accommodation or at a restaurant.
			<br>
			<br>
			For more great island hopping, make sure to visit Port Barton in Palawan.</p>

				<div><h3> Sugba Lagoon   </h3>
				<p>One of the most popular tourist spots in Siargao is Sugba Lagoon.
				It’s hard not to enjoy the lagoon’s beautiful turquoise waters that 
				will entice you in for a swim. The boat ride to the lagoon is also 
				quite pleasant as you pass mangroves and stilt houses built on the 
				water.</p> 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="seven">
			<p>If you’d prefer, it’s possible to visit Sugba Lagoon independently. To do this, 
			we recommend reading this article on visiting Sugba Lagoon without a tour.
			<br>
			Once you’re at the lagoon itself there is a small restaurant that will let you use 
			their tables for 50 pesos. Food is quite expensive so we recommend bringing your own 
			if possible. There’s a diving board, which is free to use, and kayaks and 
			paddleboards are available to rent too.
			<br>
			We’d also advise against a trip to Sugba Lagoon in bad weather. When we 
			visited it was particularly rainy and as you’ll be spending a lot of time 
			outdoors it can certainly dampen the mood!

				<div><h3><center> SUNSET </center></h3>
				<p> If you’re wondering what to do in Siargao as the day comes to a 
				close, head to General Luna pier. Walk all the way to the end of the
				pier and you can enjoy the sunset free of the crowds found at Cloud 9 or you can 
				joy ride using a boat at Sohoton and in Secret Mangrove Wharf. </p> 
				</div>
			</div>

				<h3> SUNSET @Cloud 9 Pier</h3>
				<p> I mentioned earlier in this post that the Cloud 9 
				pier can get a little busy at night but it’s all relative.
				You will have space to sit down on the edge of the hut and
				watch as the pastels in the sky burn and slowly dim. Watch 
				the last surfers retire from the waves below as the sky darkens.</p> 
			</div>
			<div class="seven">
				<img src="images/sohset.jpg" width="350">
				<h3> SUNSET @Sohoton </h3>
				<p>Finally, you should end your day on a beach or in your boat 
				like us, enjoying this epic region as the sky lights up. 
				We were blessed with an absolute belter of a sunset. Fiery red
				marked the end of the best day ever!</p> 
			</div>
			<div class="seven">
				<img src="images/wharfset.jpg" width="350">
				<h3> SUNSET @Secret Mangrove Wharf </h3>
				<p>Just before you reach Del Carmen, a small town in 
				the northeast of Siargao you will unknowingly pass one 
				of the best sunset spots on the island. This is one of 
				my favorite things to do in Siargao and each time I visited
				this magic spot I was the only tourist around.
				<br>
				<br>
				The wharf extends out towards the mangroves 
				which are the focal piece of the view along with the 
				perfectly still water. When we first saw this water 
				so still, we knew it would be an amazing spot for a 
				colorful reflection if the sunset blew up.
