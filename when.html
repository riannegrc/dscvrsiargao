			<h3> Best time to visit Siargao Island </h3>
			<p>The dry season in Siargao is between March and October, so this 
			is the best time to visit in terms of weather. If surfing is one of 
			your main reasons for visiting, then the best time to surf in Siargao 
			is between July and December with September and October being particularly
			good months.
			<br>
			<br>
			Surf competitions run at this time of year so the island is 
			at its busiest – so book your accommodation in advance if you can!
			<br>
			<br>
			As Siargao is increasing in popularity it is becoming a somewhat busy
			destination all year round. When we visited in March 2018 we found our 
			accommodation options quite limited despite booking a fair while in advance.

			<h3>Where to stay in Siargao Island</h3>
			<p>Finding accommodation in Siargao can be hard as the options are quite
			limited and tend to book up quite far in advance. There currently don’t 
			seem to be enough hotels and resorts on Siargao Island to cope with the 
			number of visitors. We planned our trip around 2 months in advance and 
			found our options extremely limited so we’d definitely recommend booking 
			as far in advance as possible. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In terms of the best area to stay in Siargao, we’d recommend either 
			General Luna or Cloud 9. If you’re planning your trip, we recommend 
			booking somewhere on Agoda as soon as possible – they often have great 
			deals but if you leave it too late your options will be limited.
